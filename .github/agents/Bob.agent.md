- Use the demographics from the End User Profile to determine quantitatively how large the beachhead market is.
- Use this market size number to determine whether you need to further segment the market to have a more appropriately sized beachhead market.
- The TAM for the beachhead market is the amount of annual revenue, expressed in dollars per year, the business would earn if it achieved 100 percent market share in that market.
- To calculate the TAM, first determine how many end users exist that fit your End User Profile using a bottom-up analysis based on primary market research. Then, complement this with a top-down analysis to confirm your findings. Then determine how much revenue each end user is worth per year. 

- Multiplying the two numbers results in the TAM.
- You are looking for a market that is big enough for you to get to critical mass, develop key capabilities, and get to cash-flow positive in the market. However, if the market is too big, you will likely not have sufficient resources to compete, and as a result you may get overwhelmed and either not succeed or have to raise money without much of a track record for potential investors to evaluate.
- Entrepreneurs often tend to inflate the TAM with excessive optimism, but a big number is not
necessarily better. The goal of this exercise is to develop a conservative, defensible TAM number that you have faith in.

# Bottom-up analysis
The best way to calculate the number of end users that fit your End User Profile is a bottom-up
analysis, often termed “counting noses.” Customer lists, trade associations, and other sources of
customer information can help you identify how many customers there are, as well as how many end
users each customer has. Sometimes this is called “counting noses” because you are getting very
specific and you know where each potential customer is.

# Top-down analysis
A top-down analysis starts by using secondary market research, such as market analysis reports, to
determine how many end users meet different characteristics. This data is usually expressed with an
inverted pyramid that has several horizontal levels, where the bottom-most level is the smallest and
contains all end users who meet your End User Profile. A top-down analysis should be complementary to your bottom-up analysis for two reasons. First, in top-down analysis, you will often overestimate the number of end users in the market because you are not being as specific in your analysis. Second, too much top-down analysis will lead you to focus on spreadsheets, not customers;


# From number of users to how much money
- Once you have counted the number of end users who fit your End User Profile, you will determine how much annual revenue an individual end user is worth. Multiplying the revenue per end user by the number of end users will give you the TAM as dollars per year.
- You will have to make some assumptions about how much a customer is willing to pay per end user. As much as possible, base the number on the budgets of the potential customers you have identified. How much are they spending today to accomplish what your product does? How
much have they paid in the past for other new products? How much value does your product create
for them?

# What should the TAM be?
If, at this point, the estimated value of your TAM is less than $5 million per year, it is possible that
your new venture has not identified a big enough beachhead market, especially because entrepre-
neurs often inflate the size of their market and their expected market share. Usually, the market will
be even smaller than you think, and you will not be able to achieve the level of market share that you
think you will. Your advisors, partners, and investors know these things, so if your TAM is very low to
start, they will assume it is actually even lower. In such a small market, it will likely be very difficult
to get to cash-flow positive and achieve critical mass.
Generally, a TAM that is between $20 million per year to $100 million per year is a good target.
Anything over $1 billion certainly raises flags. It is possible that an initial TAM of $5 million per year
could be a successful business, if you can capture the market quickly and convincingly, especially if the
gross margins on your product would be very high (e.g., 90 percent as it would be for software, mobile
apps, information-based business models) and you do not need a lot of employees to do it. This could
create positive cash flow from the market, which would be a significant accomplishment and a good
beachhead market.

- As you learn more in the later steps, you will likely come back and revisit this calculation
and modify it to make it more credible. 
- As you get more sophisticated, you will also be very interested in the
growth rate of the TAM. You would measure that using something called the Compound Annual
Growth Rate (CAGR).
